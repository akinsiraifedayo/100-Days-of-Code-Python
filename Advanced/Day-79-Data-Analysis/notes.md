### Learning Points & Summary

Today I learned how to: 

- use histograms to visualise distributions

- superimpose histograms on top of each other even when the data series have different lengths

- use a to smooth out kinks in a histogram and visualise a distribution with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)

- improve a KDE by specifying boundaries on the estimates

- use scipy and test for statistical significance by looking at p-values.

- highlight different parts of a time series chart in Matplotib.

- add and configure a Legend in Matplotlib.

- use NumPy's `.where()` function to process elements depending on a condition.
