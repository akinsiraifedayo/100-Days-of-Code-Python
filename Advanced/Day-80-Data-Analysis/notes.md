### Learning Points and Summary
Today I learned how to: 

- spot relationships in a dataset using Seaborn's `.pairplot()`

- split the data into a training and testing dataset to better evaluate a model's performance.

- run a multivariable regression.

- evaluate that regression-based on the sign of its coefficients.

- analyse and look for patterns in a model's residuals.

- improve a regression model using (a log) data transformation.

- specify your own values for various features and use your model to make a prediction.
