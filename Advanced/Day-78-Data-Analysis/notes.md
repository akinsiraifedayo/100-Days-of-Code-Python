### Learning Points and Summary
In this lesson, we reviewed many concepts that we've covered previously, including how to:

- uncover and investigate NaN values.

- convert objects and string data types to numbers.

- create donut and bar charts with plotly.

- create a rolling average to smooth out time-series data and show a trend.

- use `.value_counts()`, `.groupby()`, `.merge()`, `.sort_values()` and `.agg()`.



In addition, we learned many new things too. We looked at how to:

- create a Choropleth to display data on a map.

- create bar charts showing different segments of the data with plotly.

- create Sunburst charts with plotly.

- use Seaborn's `.lmplot()` and show best-fit lines across multiple categories using the row, hue, and lowess parameters.

- understand how a different picture emerges when looking at the same data in different ways (e.g., box plots vs a time series analysis).

- see the distribution of our data and visualise descriptive statistics with the help of a histogram in Seaborn.
