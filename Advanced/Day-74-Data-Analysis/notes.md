### Learning Points & Summary

In this lesson we looked at how to:

- use `.describe()` to quickly see some descriptive statistics at a glance.

- use `.resample()` to make a time-series data comparable to another by changing the periodicity.

- work with `matplotlib.dates` Locators to better style a timeline (e.g., an axis on a chart).

- find the number of NaN values with `.isna().values.sum()`

- change the resolution of a chart using the figure's dpi

- create dashed `--` and dotted `-.` lines using linestyles

- use different kinds of markers (e.g., `o` or `^`) on charts.

- Fine-tune the styling of Matplotlib charts by using limits, labels, linewidth and colours (both in the form of named colours and HEX codes).

- use `.grid()` to help visually identify seasonality in a time series.
